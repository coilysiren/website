// Every route the build emits, in one place so the accessibility and weight
// specs cannot disagree about what the site is. A unit assertion in
// src/build-output.test.ts compares this to dist/ and fails on drift, because
// the first accessibility pass listed eight of eighteen routes and missed a
// real defect on a promoted post.
//
// It is a module rather than derived at run time because `allowCypressEnv` is
// deliberately false here, and a spec cannot generate its tests from a promise.
//
// Docs-mount routes are the exception: they derive from the manifests, so a
// synced page cannot be missing from the accessibility and weight sweeps.
