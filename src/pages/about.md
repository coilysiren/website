I’m Kai Siren (preferred name), AKA Lynn Conway (legal name), a DevOps engineer with a decade of industry experience. I’m 50% dev (mostly Python) and 50% ops (mostly AWS). I have working experience writing in 6 programming languages - Python, Golang, and NodeJS being the strongest. I’m familiar with deploying to AWS, GCP, and Azure - and multi-cloud setups between them.

My career goal is to empower engineering teams to reach their limits of productive potential. I weave this into my DevOps engineering practice, via helping teams quickly deliver high-quality products and services. Every job, every team, every project - is a new chance to learn and grow our collective ability to create. Or another chance for me to create something that I can spin off into its own DevOps product, whichever.

I’ve often been primarily responsible for implementing operations systems - like application monitoring, data pipelines, and deployment tooling - from scratch. Most of my career has been as an IC engineer, and I managed a small team at EnergyHub.

I enjoy gaming, game development, gardening, and crafts. I also run a game server, which sits right on the intersection of the personal and the professional!

Words to describe my work include: DevOps Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer, Platform Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer.
