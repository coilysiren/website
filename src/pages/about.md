I'm **Kai Siren** (preferred name), AKA **Lynn Conway** (legal name). I'm a platform engineer with over 10 years of experience building high-impact systems that empower engineering teams. I'm proficient in six programming languages, with Python, Go, and JavaScript as my strongest. I have hands-on experience deploying to AWS, GCP, and Azure, including designing multi-cloud environments. Across technologies and cloud platforms, I specialize in meeting engineers where they are and helping teams move faster and more effectively.

My career is powered by a passion for enabling engineering teams to achieve their highest potential. I bring this focus to every role, ensuring that teams deliver high-quality products and services quickly and efficiently. Each project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and strengthen our collective capabilitiesâ€”or to create tools and platforms that become valuable products in their own right.

Throughout my career, I've been primarily responsible for implementing operations systems - like application monitoring, data pipelines, and deployment tooling - from scratch. This hands-on experience has honed my skills as an IC engineer, and I also managed a small team at EnergyHub.

Outside work, I enjoy gaming, game development, gardening, and crafts. I also manage a game server, a unique intersection of my personal and professional interests.
