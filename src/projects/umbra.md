title: umbra, a config driven occlusion framework | Kai Siren
description: You gave an agent a shell. Now name every command it can run. umbra validates argv before execve, checks a scope token per verb, and appends every call to an audit log.

The answer is spread across a system prompt, a tool definition, an allowlist
somebody added during an incident, and whichever binaries happen to be on the
container. When something goes wrong the question changes from what was allowed to
what actually happened, and that answer is usually worse, because what you have is
an agent transcript rather than a log.

The expensive failure is not the runaway agent that deletes a repository. That one
is rare and memorable. The expensive failure is that you cannot answer either
question in a review, so the safe call is to give the agent less than it needs, and
the automation quietly stays a demo.

             heading: "umbra sits between semi-trusted automation and the host system." } %}
What you did not declare does not get through. The boundary lives in a KDL guardfile
rather than in code, so it is one artifact a reviewer reads in a sitting. umbra ships
no denylist and knows nothing about your tools. The policy is yours, and umbra
enforces it across two surfaces: subprocess execution and outbound HTTP requests.

### What it checks

<dl class="project__deflist">
  <div><dt>argv</dt><dd>Validated before <code>execve</code>.</dd></div>
  <div><dt>scope token</dt><dd>Checked per verb.</dd></div>
  <div><dt>repo state</dt><dd>Repo-shaped verbs are refused on a dirty tree.</dd></div>
  <div><dt>egress</dt><dd>Gated through a per-invocation CONNECT proxy.</dd></div>
  <div><dt>audit log</dt><dd>Every call appended to a rotating JSONL file.</dd></div>
</dl>

A public exit-code taxonomy lets an orchestrator tell a policy refusal apart from a
tool failure, which is the difference between retrying and stopping.

`commit` is reachable and `--no-verify` is not.
`reflog expire` is refused outright. Every subcommand nobody named
is unreachable, because grants are deny-by-default and an unknown node fails closed.

It performs no execution isolation at all, and that is deliberate rather than
unfinished. It is audit-and-gate.

Four defences get conflated constantly and none substitutes for another.

umbra also ships no denylist, so an empty guardfile grants nothing and protects
nothing. The policy is the thing you write, not the thing you install.
